>>> Server

Built with Racket, a MPD abstraction layer can be found in `mpd.rkt`, in case
anyone needs a MPD protocol library in Racket, you can easily modify the code to
support more MPD protocol standards.

`server.rkt` includes a simple WebSocket server that updates information
(current and next song information) and send the information over time with a
WebSocket connection.

>>> Web Frontend

Built with JavaScript and React.JS, I don't know how to code websites.

>>> Development and Deployment Prerequisites

- Guix users: `guix shell -m manifest.scm`
- Others: Install Racket programming language and Node.JS on your favorite
  operating system.

You also need a MPD server running locally, and don't forget to change the
hardcoded URLs in `web/src/App.js`.

To run the server, simply execute `racket ./server.rkt <PORT>`. The server will
start listening on `0.0.0.0:<PORT>`.
