>>> Server

Built with Racket, a MPD abstraction layer can be found in `mpd.rkt`, in case
anyone needs a MPD protocol library in Racket, you can easily modify the code to
support more MPD protocol standards.

`server.rkt` includes a simple WebSocket server that updates information
(current and next song information) and send the information overtime with a
WebSocket connection.

>>> Web Frontend

Built with JavaScript and React.JS, I don't know how to code websites.
